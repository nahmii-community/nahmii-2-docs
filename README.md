# Getting started with the Nahmii 2.0 testnet

## About Nahmii 2.0

Nahmii 2.0 is a layer 2 for Ethereum built around the Nahmii Virtual Machine, nVM. This upgraded version of Nahmii provides generalised smart contract support and full composability between them. Nahmii leverages patent-pending state pool technology which gives unprecedented scalability. This makes Nahmii the only commercially viable scaling solution for Ethereum.

## Connecting to the Nahmii 2.0 testnet

The current testnet iteration of Nahmii 2.0 works with both a private instance of Ethereum and a L2 network. It is thus required to connect to two RPC networks.

### Network details

L2 testnet
- Network name: Nahmii 2.0 - Ropsten
- RPC URL: https://l2.testnet.nahmii.io/
- ChainID: 5553
- Symbol: ETH
- Block explorer URL: https://explorer.testnet.nahmii.io/

### Connect with the press of a button

Navigate to the [connect-nahmii-2](https://nahmii-community.github.io/connect-nahmii-2/) web app and press on the `ADD NAHMII ROPSTEN` button. The app will request you to add the selected network. Approve the request. The network should be added to your Ethereum provider.

### Connect manually via MetaMask

1. Open the MetaMask browser extension.
2. Click on the network name.
3. When the networks window pops up, click on 'Custom RPC'.
4. A new window will popup where you can fill in the connection details. Fill in the details provided above for the first network and click save.
5. Do this again for the second network listed above.

## Nahmii 2.0 Meta contracts L1 <-> L2

Nahmii 2.0 provides a number of contracts on L1 to interact with the L2 and vica versa. The meta data of these contracts can be found [here](https://meta.testnet.nahmii.io/addresses.json).

The main contract that is relevant for developers is the AddressManager. The AddressManager provides easy accesss to all the other contracts and exposes their addresses. For examples on how to interact with the Nahmii 2.0 L2 contracts, please see the provided examples.

## Configuring a project to run on Nahmii 2.0

To compile the correct bytecode to work with the Nahmii virtual machine, the hardhat-nvm dependency is required due to the differences between certain opcodes in the EVM and the NVM.

1. Install the NVM hardhat plugin.

```js
yarn add @nahmii/hardhat-nvm
```

2. Edit `hardhat.config.js` to use the NVM package.

```js
// hardhat.config.js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require('@nahmii/hardhat-nvm')

...
```

3. In the same file, add `nahmii` to the list of networks:
Note: Update the **accounts** fields to fit your personal setup.

```js
...

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.7.6",
  networks: {
    nahmii: {
      url: 'https://l2.testnet.nahmii.io/',
      accounts: { mnemonic: 'test test test test test test test test test test test junk' },
      gasPrice: 15000000,
      nvm: true
    }
  }
};
```

4. To test contracts on the live Nahmii L2, compile it with hardhat:

```
npx hardhat --network nahmii test
```

5. To interact with the smart contracts manually, use the console. The JavaScript console can be ran with the following command:

```
npx hardhat --network nahmii console
```
